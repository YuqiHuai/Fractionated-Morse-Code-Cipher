# Fractioned Morse Code Cipher

> The Fractionated Morse cipher first converts the plaintext to morse code, then enciphers fixed size blocks of morse code back to letters. This procedure means plaintext letters are mixed into the ciphertext letters i.e. one plaintext letter does not map to one ciphertext letter. This makes it more secure than e.g. substitution ciphers, but it can still be broken with some effort.

> One of the benefits of the Fractioned Morse cipher is that it can encipher spaces and punctuation just as easily as letters. The ciphertext message will generally be of a similar length to the plaintext message, but often will have a slightly different number of characters.
